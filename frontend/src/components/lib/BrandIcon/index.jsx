 * Brand marks that lucide does not ship.
 *
 * lucide dropped its brand icons over trademark concerns, so the six logos the
 * app still needs live here instead of pulling a second icon package in for
 * them. The glyphs are the `fill` weight from Phosphor Icons (MIT, © 2023
 * Phosphor Icons) traced on Phosphor's 256x256 grid.
 *
 * The props mirror lucide's: `size` sets both dimensions, `className` merges,
 * and the glyph paints with `currentColor` so text utilities colour it.
